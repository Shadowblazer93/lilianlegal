# Terms and Conditions
Last Updated : April 30, 2024

By inviting and using our bot you automatically agree to our Terms of Service below.
___

By accepting Lilian ("our", "we", "us") Terms of Service ("ToS") you agree that you've agreed to Discords ToS and meet every requirement mentioned there.

The information provided on the Bot is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Bot from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Bot is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Bot.

The Bot is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Bot. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Use prior to you using the Bot.

The bot does not store any information or record of its users. You have the right to use our service as long as you don't use it in any way that would break Discords ToS or the rules of the guild ("server") you're in. We reserve the right to permanently block you from our services, deny support and/or services or report you to discord.

We are not responsible for content generated via our bot by users that is violating Discords ToS in any way.

You agree that by accessing the Bot, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE BOT AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Bot so that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Bot after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.
